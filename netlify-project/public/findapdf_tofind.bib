  abstract = {Purposebecause steadily growing consumption is not beneficial for nature and climate and is not the same as increasing well-being, an anti-consumerism movement has formed worldwide. the renouncement of dispensable consumption will, however, only establish itself as a significant lifestyle if consumers do not perceive reduced consumption as a personal sacrifice. since prior research has not yielded a consistent understanding of the relationship between anti-consumption and personal well-being, this paper aims to examine three factors about which theory implies that they may moderate this relationship: decision-control empowerment, market-control empowerment and the value of materialism. design/methodology/approachthe analysis is based on data from a large-scale, representative online survey (n = 1,398). structural equation modelling with latent interaction effects is used to test how three moderators (decision-control empowerment, market-control empowerment and materialism) affect the relationship amongst four types of anti-consumption (e.g. voluntary simplicity) and three different well-being states (e.g. subjective well-being). findingswhile both dimensions of empowerment almost always directly promote consumer well-being, significant moderation effects are present in only a few but meaningful cases. although the materialism value tends to reduce consumers' well-being, it improves the well-being effect of two anti-consumption styles. research limitations/implicationsusing only one sample from a wealthy country is a limitation of the study. researchers should replicate the findings in different nations and cultures. practical implicationsconsumer affairs practitioners and commercial marketing for sustainably produced, high-quality and long-lasting goods can benefit greatly from these findings. social implicationsthis paper shows that sustainable marketing campaigns can more easily motivate consumers to voluntarily reduce their consumption for the benefit of society and the environment if a high level of market-control empowerment can be communicated to them. originality/valuethis study provides differentiated new insights into the roles of consumer empowerment, i.e. both decision-control empowerment and market-control empowerment, and the value of materialism to frame specific relationships between different anti-consumption types and various well-being states.},

  abstract = {. leisure air travel is a popular form of tourism, but its emissions are a major contributor to anthropogenic climate change. restrictions to leisure air travel have previously received little support, however, the same restrictions to mitigate the spread of covid-19 have been popular. this support is unlikely to persist in a postpandemic world, highlighting the need for alternative ways to improve support for reducing leisure air travel. anthropomorphism of nature has consistently predicted proenvironmental behavior, which has been mediated by guilt felt for harm to the environment. this research is the first empirical study to explore this relationship in the context of covid-19, where it examined support for restricting leisure air travel to help mitigate (1) covid-19 and (2) climate change. in an experimental online study, australian residents (n = 325, m-age = 54.48, sdage = 14.63, 62\% women) were recruited through social media. anthropomorphism of nature in the context of covid-19 (amp-19) was manipulated through exposure to a news article. participants then completed measures of environmental guilt and support for restricting leisure air travel to mitigate covid-19 (lat-19) and to mitigate climate change (lat-cc). a significant indirect effect was observed in both models, such that amp-19 predicted environmental guilt which in turn predicted lat-19 (f(2) = .26, bci [0.66, 3.87]) and lat-cc (f(2) = .45, bci [0.84, 5.06]). the results imply that anthropomorphism of nature in the context of covid-19 can improve attitudes toward this proenvironmental behavior, with greater support when this was to mitigate climate change. implications are discussed.},

  abstract = {Several years ago, proponents of the sustainable development (sd) approach identified four levels of impact of sustainable lifestyles (sls) and actions on people's wellbeing. accordingly, a sustainable society was presumed to positively affect the ecological, social, economic and political-institutional scenarios in which people live and thrive. more recently, a number of government and social institutions have added a psychological dimension to this list of levels of impact of sd. for these governments and institutions, psychological wellbeing should be a positive consequence of sustainability. an incipient research in environmental psychology reinforces such an idea, demonstrating that people who practice pro-environmental behaviors are happier individuals. also, psychological restoration (i.e., retrieval from exhausted psychological capabilities and health) is assumed to derive from living in sustainable scenarios. moreover, sustainability, as practiced in the form of pro-environmental behaviors, not only is linked to their psychological consequences but also to psychological antecedents of sustainable lifestyles. more than forty years of research have demonstrated that sls are predicted by affective and cognitive determinants of behavior. in this paper i review studies and views encompassing the psychological dimensions of sustainability. the basic idea is that it is human psychology (i.e., environmentally destructive behaviors and propensities) the main cause of the current ecological crisis, but human behavior is also a paramount solution. thus, any interventional strategy to be successful has to consider the psychological determinants, the remedial behaviors, and also the positive consequences linked to more sustainable behaviors. consequently, for analytical reasons, i identify: 1) psychological antecedents, and 2) psychological consequences of 3) sustainable behaviors. all these three levels are subject to scientific scrutiny within the realm of environmental psychology and related areas. the psychological antecedents of sustainable actions include dimensions such as environmental emotions, affinity towards diversity, ecological worldviews, future orientation, pro-environmental deliberation, pro-environmental norms and values, and pro-environmental competency, among others, which are described in this chapter. the psychological consequences of sustainability are subjective wellbeing or happiness, and psychological restoration, but a number of positive outcomes are to be added to this list. in turn, sustainable behaviors (or lifestyles) encompass pro-ecological, frugal, equitable and altruistic behaviors, which are actions resulting in the conservation of the socio-physical environment. therefore, this chapter stresses the idea that psychology is a key constituent of sustainability. since the environmental dilemma emerged as a consequence of human drives (i.e., motivations for exploiting and depredating the environment), and capacities (human intelligence and potential for exploiting natural resources), an important component of the solution to this dilemma has to be found in exploring human psychology across the three levels above identified. also, in studying how human potentials (emotions, competency, deliberation, anticipation, etc.) can be converted into solutions to environmental problems.},

This perspective promotes a planned reduction of energy and resource use in the Global North to limit environmental pressures and global inequalities and improving well-being. Yet, the specifics of this “design” are not precisely delineated. On the one hand, there is a wide acceptance, at the abstract, most general, even definitional level, that degrowth involves planning or amounts to a planned transition. On the other hand, there is strikingly little explicit engagement with, debate on, and research into what exactly “planning beyond growth” could look like. This gap urgently needs to be addressed. By exploring the degrowth-planning nexus, this paper seeks to lay a foundation for this effort. First, it identifies in the degrowth/postgrowth literature the obstacles and the opportunities for further engagement with planning.

While degrowth is often associated with prefigurative politics, there is emerging interest among degrowth proponents in contentious mass politics and engagement with other social movements. Debate has thus emerged over what kinds of social forces might be mobilised in pursuit of a degrowth transition. Some degrowth scholars and activists have identified organised labour as a potential ally. However, discussion of the trade union movement is scarce in degrowth literature. This article briefly examines the debates emerging in the degrowth literature on organised labour, as well as the left ecomodernist class critique of degrowth. It then addresses the theoretical gap in these debates, drawing on Marxian and Gramscian approaches to understand labour's “double bind” of exploitation and growth dependency. Based on this analysis, a range of non-reformist reforms are identified that aim to break the link between economic growth and workers' wellbeing. I argue that breaking this dependency is not only a crucial step towards a socially sustainable degrowth transition, it also reduces capital's coercive power and advances the strategic position of organised labour. © 2025 The Author},

However, most modelled pathways assume continued economic growth throughout the century, even for high-income nations. This has sparked calls for modellers to expand their visions of sustainable futures. One suggested approach is post-growth, which shifts the focus of the economy from economic growth to ecological stability, equality, human well-being and enhanced democracy. In this review, we examine current post-growth scenario modelling approaches, spanning national to global scales and single-sector to whole-economy approaches, to identify best practices and key gaps in representing a post-growth transition. We develop a framework for evaluating these scenarios along five key dimensions of post-growth theorisation: feasible technological change, scale-down of harmful production, good life for all, wealth redistribution, and international justice. We then explore current approaches to post-growth scenario modelling, focusing on the types of models used, the mechanisms employed to simulate post-growth scenarios and the representation of post-growth policies. Finally, drawing on the wider post-growth literature, we offer recommendations for improving post-growth model representation, focusing on five main areas: the energy-economy connection, spatial differentiation, sectoral differentiation, the inclusion of different provisioning systems and feasibility considerations. © 2025 The Author(s).

  abstract = {This paper examines the potential macroeconomic impacts on countries and regions in the Global South arising from a reduction in the material footprint of countries in the Global North. Using environmentally extended (multi-regional) input-output analysis, we develop and compare stylised scenarios of two alternative green transition strategies— ‘green growth’ and ‘degrowth’ — each of which aims to achieve such a reduction through different mechanisms.The findings reveal that, on average, both scenarios lead to reductions in GDP, employment, and a worsening in the balance of trade (as a percentage of GDP) in the Global South. These outcomes highlight that, regardless of the strategy adopted, the green transition in the Global North risks exacerbating economic vulnerabilities and triggering macroeconomic crises in Global South countries under the prevailing patterns of trade and productive specialisation. The paper argues that a just and sustainable green transition requires not only reductions in material consumption in the Global North but also a fundamental restructuring of development strategies in the Global South. This entails moving away from neo-extractivism—characterised by reliance on raw material exports and the import of manufactured goods —towards diversified and equitable economic models that reduce structural dependencies and enhance resilience. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.},

The identified literature has been analysed using the new concept of ‘organisational value creation patterns’. Based on this concept, value is created for (and with) stakeholders when problems are solved through organisational activities. The result is a compilation of thirty-nine degrowth-oriented patterns of organisational value creation, structured into seven thematic groups.

Design/methodology/approach - This exploratory study uses a qualitative approach to understand consumers' perceptions of value towards second-hand fashion consumption. Findings - This research uses the theoretical model of the means-end chain model and shows five consumer's values of second-hand consumers: price-consciousness, consciousness on emotional bonds, comfortability consciousness, quality and brand consciousness and social and environmental consciousness. Furthermore, the authors show non-second-hand fashion consumers' values as social status consciousness, hygienic consciousness, comfortability consciousness, quality and brand consciousness and self-expressive consciousness. Originality/value - This research sheds some light on the emerging knowledge of second-hand consumption. This research further points out certain practical implications by drawing attention to a few opportunities and challenges associated with the second-hand fashion business within the Sri Lankan fashion retail sector, in particular when launching new fashion brands catering to second-hand fashion consumers.},

  abstract = {Repair is an overlooked but important aspect of consumer behavior with implications for the social and environmental sustainability of consumption. this ethnographic study examines the interplay of repair and consumption by analyzing when and how consumers repair the objects they use. the analysis examines how conflicting and complementary practice elements can lead to object replacement and disposal or, alternatively, facilitate object repair and extended use. results unfold how consumers calibrate their routine activities around the continually changing material capacities of objects. consumers engage in repair as a response to worn or damaged objects that misalign from and often disrupt ongoing practices. repairers, including consumers and professional service providers, attempt to adjust object capacities in ways that realign disrupted practices with the routinized ways that consumers do them. when successful, repair sustains consumer practices by avoiding prolonged disruption and unnecessary waste. however, conflicts between production, consumption, and repair can hinder the efficacy of repair interventions and shape whether and how consumers repair the objects they use. the article explains these challenges and concludes by discussing their implications for studies of repair, consumer practices, and sustainable consumption.},

  abstract = {Understanding how consumption patterns affect the environment and shape well-being hinges on the rationale that the data collected on what is consumed, who consumes it, and where it is consumed are indeed accurate. to identify these consumption patterns and recommend corresponding policies, researchers and policy makers often rely on national surveys. studies have explored the accuracy of individual surveys and the level of agreement across surveys of the same type (e.g. household expenditures), but no studies have compared representative national surveys measuring consumption in different ways. this study compares household consumption measured as expenditures and as material consumption (i.e. physical units) to assess how well we currently measure what we consume. we use multiple rigorous, national surveys to estimate meat consumption, household energy use, and private automobile use in the united states, with consumption profiles parsed by affluence, race/ethnicity, and education. our results indicate that commonly used surveys may not accurately track important aspects of household consumption. for meat consumption, which included 30 consumption profiles detailing the consumption patterns across different demographic characteristics and meat types (e.g. kilograms beef consumed/capita for caucasians), there is considerable disagreement between data sources for 20 profiles. by contrast, national surveys accurately measure household energy and transport (disagreement for four profiles). our findings indicate that national surveys more accurately measure consistently tracked, standardized consumables like electricity than irregularly tracked, variable goods such as food. these results cast doubt on studies that use national surveys to draw conclusions about the how the environmental impacts of food, and, potentially, other goods (e.g. manufactured goods) vary across demographic groups. overcoming this challenge will necessitate new surveys, updating legacy databases, and harnessing breakthroughs in data science.},

Our review reveals, inter alia, that the existing literature focuses mainly on the synergy narrative, and that there is a strong focus on theoretical and qualitative methodology. We argue that future research might want to put more emphasis on the investigation of structural dependencies between the North and South, using a broader methodological toolkit than so far. Only then one can effectively address what we call the ‘twin problem of global dependencies’: the fact that within the current institutional framework, these dependencies are a motivation for and a potential obstacle to degrowth at the same time. © 2023 The Authors},

  abstract = {The rapid growth of the sharing economy has received much attention by recent studies. Most of them focus on the impacts on the rental markets, and sharing is seen as a perfect substitute to rental. Since evidence shows that the sharing business has also greatly affected sales markets and manufacturers, this paper attempts to bridge the gap by examining the overall effects of sharing business on rentals, sales, production, and labor employment in a differentiated product model. Renting from firms and from private owners are different in the quality instability of sharing business. By assuming heterogeneous consumers with different risk attitudes, we characterize the equilibrium for this imperfect competition market. Our results show that sharing business not only decreases the rental prices, it also decreases the retail prices. The demand for new products will decrease, and the product supplying price, production and labor employment will also decrease. If the quality of sharing business is improved, the competition between rental and sharing products becomes more severe. Both selling and rental prices will decrease, but the price of sharing business will increase. Our model suggests that for existing rental firms, increasing product heterogeneity can reduce the impacts from sharing business. For the producers, our analysis suggests to increase the replacement rate through providing innovations, to provide portable “parts” to the used products, to provide post-sale services or sustainability production, and to participate in the sharing business.},

To strengthen the theoretical and methodological foundations of PGE and overcome some of the cleavages between Marxist (and other) analyses and critiques of capitalism and De-/Post-Growth, this article develops a theoretical framework of 21st century capitalism and elaborates on the implications for De-/Post-Growth. For that purpose, it synthesises insights from within and outside PGE, drawing on heterodox schools of economic thought whose potential has so far not been fully harnessed by PGE scholars, most notably Marxist Political Economy. One central result is that the renunciation of economic growth and the reorientation of the economy towards sustainability and wellbeing necessitate a deeper transformation of the social relations of capitalism. Breaking the system's growth dependence requires the dissolution of the system's dependence on profit, wage labour, the private ownership and unequal distribution of essential resources, and money as universal equivalent. It means reconfiguring interhuman relations and relations to non-human nature. To offer transformative solutions at the current historical juncture, PGE would benefit from accounting more comprehensively for the distinct challenges arising from capitalism's contemporary forms, particularly financialisation and increasing rentierism. © 2025 The Author},

Indeed, the complex constraints often discourage traditional companies from pursuing such endeavors, but a new breed of enterprises characterized by their frugal approach is emerging from this constrained environment. Nevertheless, we know little about how these frugal enterprises transform constraints into opportunities through innovative business models that include collaboration with local and international partners, as well as how they can contribute to sustainable development. Drawing on institutional theory perspective and the resource-based view, this article explores how frugal enterprises create business models for serving overlooked customers in emerging markets and overcoming the various constraints and institutional voids. Based on six cases of frugal enterprise and 22 interviews, this qualitative study contributes to the literature in the following three ways. First, it reveals how frugal enterprises transform constraints and institutional voids into viable business models for serving traditionally underserved customers. Second, it sheds light on how these enterprises engage with local and international partners to overcome the constraints in emerging markets. Finally, it demonstrates that frugal enterprises contribute to sustainable development in a profitable manner. The findings offer valuable insights to guide managers and policymakers in attaining sustainability and profitability in the emerging markets.},

Design/methodology/approach: A meta-analysis was conducted on 90 articles about HPEBs published between 2009 and 2023 to find the key factors. HPEBs were further categorized into HWM and HES to investigate the difference influenced by the above factors on two behaviors. The correlation coefficient was used as the unified effect size, and the random-effect model was adopted to conduct both main effect and moderating effect tests. Findings: The results showed that attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control all positively influenced intention and HPEBs, but their effects were stronger on intention than on HPEBs. Intention was found to be the strongest predictor of HPEBs. Subjective norms were found to have a more positive effect on HES compared to HWM, while habits had a more positive effect on HWM. Furthermore, household size was negatively correlated with HWM but positively correlated with HES. Originality/value: The same variables have different influences on HWM and HES.

  abstract = {The context of this research is the ageing population in australia and its implications for housing and urban development. ageing in place is a key policy response to population ageing, but this begs the question: ageing in what kind of place? it is well established that a significant majority of older australians live in detached suburban dwellings of three or more bedrooms (abs 2011a) which are often regarded by policy-makers as under-utilised (batten 1999, judd et al. 2010, wulff et al. 2004). much urban policy is premised on the assumption that an ageing population will require more diverse (implying smaller) housing stock into which older people will (or should) downsize. however, little is known about older people's downsizing behaviours (judd et al. 2012). aims the broad aim of this research was to understand more fully the phenomenon of downsizing in the australian context including: the extent of downsizing amongst older australians, who downsizes and why, what is involved in the process, what are the outcomes, what obstacles discourage downsizing, and what policies could facilitate downsizing where appropriate and desired by older people. definitions this project accepts a broad definition of downsizing which encompasses a decrease in dwelling size (i.e. number of rooms and/or spatial dimensions), and/or garden/yard area), and/or monetary value. however, for practical purposes a reduction in the number of bedrooms is used as a proxy for downsizing in analysing abs and other survey data. for the purposes of this study, older people are regarded as those aged 50 years or over, in order to capture the pre-retirement cohort who may be making decisions about their housing futures. 'older downsizers' are therefore those who have moved to a dwelling with fewer bedrooms since turning 50 years of age. another category, 'other movers' are those who changed their dwelling without reducing the number of bedrooms. both homeowners and tenants are included in the study, along with residents of retirement villages under loan/lease tenure. approach and methods the research is approached from a person-environment theory perspective. the following methods were used in the study: a systematic literature review, reported in the positioning paper (see judd et al. 2012). analysis of relevant data from the abs census of population and housing (abs census) for the years 2001, 2006 and 2011, and the 2003 and 2009 survey of disability, ageing and carers (sdac). a national questionnaire survey of 2819 older people who had moved since turning 50 years of age, distributed with the seniors magazine 50 something. in-depth interviews with 60 survey respondents, 20 each in new south wales (nsw), victoria and south australia (sa). three policy forums using the world café method in nsw, victoria and sa. the ahuri questionnaire survey did not attempt to collect data on older people who had not moved since turning 50. hence, demographic comparisons with the population of older non-movers was not possible.},

The goal of this study is to find out what predicts eco-anxiety or sustainable and healthy eating behaviors among university students. This study was done with 605 undergraduate students. They filled out scales including eco-anxiety, the Turkish version of sustainable and healthy eating behaviors, organic food consumption, and sustainable consumption behavior. Also, the EAT-Lancet Diet scores of the participants were calculated. Pearson correlational analysis was used in order to show the correlational coefficients between scales, and multiple regression analysis was performed to determine the predictors of both climate anxiety and sustainable and healthy eating behaviors. The mean scores of eco-anxiety, meat reduction, organic food consumption, the EAT-Lancet diet, environmental awareness, and reusability were higher among female participants. Eco-anxiety was associated with some types of pro-environmental behaviors. Lower behavioral symptoms related to eco-anxiety, greater organic food consumption, and environmental awareness were associated with higher sustainable and healthy eating behaviors. These findings suggest that eco-anxiety may be considered a motivating force for pro-environmental behaviors like environmental awareness, but behavioral symptoms related to eco-anxiety may have a negative effect on sustainable and healthy eating behaviors. In order to adopt more sustainable dietary patterns, governments should inform people about the impact of their dietary choices on the environment. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

We use the United Nations–based Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) to illustrate how a multilateral environmental agreement (MEA) might differ if its foundational premises were centered on degrowth as opposed to green growth. To do this, we develop a conceptual scaffold to support the construction of a degrowth-centered MEA on sustainable global aviation. While a degrowth alternative to CORSIA is admittedly unlikely given contemporary capitalist norms in global environmental gov-ernance, our proposed scaffold nevertheless adds to the growing body of work envision-ing alternative scenarios for a just and sustainable postgrowth future. © 2023 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

Drawing on prior work by post-Keynesian economists, which showed that positive net profit for the economy as a whole is compatible with a steady-state economy if there is consumption out of wealth, this paper shows that a wealth tax can play the same role and extends the result to a degrowth pathway. This has important policy implications because the viability of degrowth and a steady state no longer rely on a behavioral parameter alone, opening the way for functional finance.

  abstract = {Shared consumption is rapidly evolving as a potential alternative consumption paradigm and hence gaining increased scholarly attention. In the last 5 years, there has been an exponential increase in research focusing on the adoption of shared consumption. There is a pressing need to consolidate and reconcile the resultant insights, which calls for an appropriate review study. Accordingly, this study aims to systematically review the extant literature on the adoption of shared consumption, synthesize the body of knowledge and provide a comprehensive understanding of this emerging consumption mode. Following the SPAR-4-SLR review protocol, this systematic review draws upon the theoretical guidance provided by the theory of consumption values, innovation resistance theory and value-attitude-behaviour hierarchy to synthesize 331 research articles. Bibliometric analysis was employed to reveal the research trend, most prominent journals, authors, articles and countries of research. A thematic analysis was carried out to synthesize the knowledge of the literature corpus. The results suggest that while economic incentives commonly drive individuals to participate in shared consumption, social incentives significantly influence participation in a peer-to-peer setting. Perceived risks (physical, privacy, safety and security) deter participation, while trust plays a vital role in adoption. It has also unveiled some inconclusive relationships in the literature, such as the effect of environmental considerations and materialism on sharing intention. The analysis shows that the providers' perspective has received less attention than the consumers. Further, it is important to empirically validate the findings in domains that transcend the extant industry specificity of studies. The salient observations were structured in an integrated model capturing the drivers and inhibitors of the adoption of the phenomenon. Finally, based on the TCCM framework, pertinent future research directions have been elaborated. © 2023 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

While much scholarly interest has focused on developing political paths towards degrowth and their associated policies, we know less about public support for such policies. Given that the suggested policies are usually quite radical or transformative, public reactions are important to determine whether the policies are politically viable. This study extends the literature by examining both support for and resistance against nine degrowth policies: reduced working hours, banning advertisements for harmful consumption, a jobs guarantee, minimum and maximum incomes, higher taxes on capital gains, alternative forms of housing, public transportation and reduced livestock production. The analysis is based on a 2024 survey performed in Denmark. While support is relatively evenly distributed among policies, resistance is concentrated on radically redistributive policies (minimum income, maximum income and capital gains) and reducing animal production. Results show that support and resistance are shaped by well-known predictors of attitudes to eco-social and environmental policies, including climate attitudes, environmental values, ideology, income and age, but these predictors also vary across policies. © 2025 The Authors},

  abstract = {The repair industry, consumer expenditure on repair and the number of repair businesses have been steadily decreasing in many european countries over the last 20-40 years. our study focuses on consumer repair as a practice, with an emphasis on the interactions between propensity to repair, experience of repair and societal rules and structures that affect repair decisions in different phases of product lifetimes. moreover, exploring the consumer repair process enables a nuanced understanding of the different paths leading to self-repair, profes-sional repair or non-repair decisions. drawing on past repair and non-repair experiences (n = 98) of young adults residing in finland, we develop a consumer repair process model reflective of the individual perceptions, but also of the structural problems that enable or impede repair in the finnish context. further, we complement this data with semi-structured interviews of selected repair industry actors and representatives of the educational sector (n = 9), discussing interventions to encourage repair in business, legal and educational systems. the results highlight the role of consumer experience of repair and its situatedness in the shared cultural context, suggesting implications for institutionalizing experience of repair in primary education and other societal activities in order to enhance consumers' propensity to repair. as a conclusion, we suggest that shifting societal perceptions and rhetoric around repair requires innovative solutions involving actors across production and consumption sys-tems. while not all countries have a strong repair cafe ` culture, explicit municipal collaboration with businesses and educators for repair can lead to the development of new services and spaces for systematically embedding repair in the society. these perspectives from the finnish settings might be particularly informative coming from a country highly involved in the circular economy.},

  abstract = {Eating meat can have detrimental effects on the environment, animal welfare, and a person's health. However, consumers are often reluctant to reduce their meat consumption and public information-based awareness campaigns show little effect. As an alternative, some vegan activists and pressure groups employ emotion-based campaigns using meat-shaming techniques in the hope to change people's meat consumption behavior. By publicly and often drastically criticizing consumers, they try to make them experience negative emotions and ultimately change their behavior. In three experimental studies, we explore whether a confrontational approach of putting meat-shaming messages on products is likely to affect consumer behavior. Specifically, we find that meat-shaming messages trigger shame but also other negative emotions that translate into reduced purchase intentions. The content of the message largely determines the different emotions that are evoked. The messages can activate both restore and protect motivations, either stimulating or hindering behavioral change. Interestingly, it does not seem to matter whether the meat-shaming message stems from a governmental organization, activist group, or private person and whether it is framed with a personal or informational appeal. If the source looks credible, the message influences consumer experience and behavioral intentions. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

(1) co-production rather than production: conviviality, care, and commons promote egalitarian opportunities to join greening efforts. (2) instead of seeing urban green spaces as commodified arenas of consumption, focus on their potential to curb economic throughput.

  abstract = {A reduction of meat consumption and shift to plant-based diets, especially in industrialized countries, is acknowledged as crucial for reaching climate targets, addressing public health problems, and protecting animal welfare. While scholarly research distilled drivers of meat consumption and barriers to its reduction, insights into the effectiveness of measures to initiate such a profound change in consumer behaviour are relatively scarce. This paper presents a systematic literature review on consumption-side interventions in the context of meat consumption across scholarly disciplines. Our analysis confirms that existing research predominantly assessed interventions addressing personal factors of behavioural change such as knowledge and emotions. Whether these interventions are effective depends on whether information (i) is provided on health, animal welfare or environmental effects, (ii) is emotionally or cognitively framed, and (iii) is aligned with consumers’ information needs. Moreover, linking meat to living animals or to the humanness of animals activates negative emotions and, thus, reduces meat consumption. Further, increasing the visibility and variety of vegetarian dishes in food environments decreases meat-eating. Also, educational courses on how to shop and cook vegetarian food are effective in reducing meat consumption. There is less evidence on the effectiveness of interventions addressing socio-cultural factors such as social norms. Regarding future research directions, existing research mainly investigated the influence of interventions on attitudes and behavioural intentions. Hence, there is still a need for studies to assess more long-term effects of intervention measures on actual meat consumption and their potential to initiate fundamental changes in dietary habits. © 2021 The Authors},

These activities can be considered forms of consumption work that may be critical for the realisation of the circular economy but lack visibility and the attribution of value (Hobson et al, 2021). We draw on findings of a survey of 2,717 households across Australia in which respondents were asked about their practices of maintaining and repairing three types of products: (1) clothing and accessories, (2) furniture and homewares, and (3) appliances and white goods. The analysis offers insights into socio-demographic patterning of households most and least likely to repair and maintain the different product types. Life stage, gender and income are particularly significant for household repair and maintenance practices. These patterns may be best explained in terms of economic capacity, necessity, and availability of time, skills and space. The dynamic between environmental, social and economic motivations for repair and maintenance may be fluid and there is evidence of a value–action gap. We argue that a strong foundation exists for household-scale consumer-driven practices that could be supported to complement parallel transitions in production systems towards product design for repairability and longevity, in line with circular economy principles. We reflect on the implications for changing social norms and practices as part of a societal scale transition towards more sustainable forms of material use, and position repair and maintenance within the social dimensions of a circular economy transition, particularly in relation to debates around green growth and degrowth. © Authors 2025.},

  abstract = {Vegetarian diets can produce beneficial consequences for animal welfare, human health, and the natural envi-ronment, but these consequences are often too distant and intangible to affect everyday food choices. in the present field experiment (n = 741 observations), we examined whether vegetarian food choices can be promoted by linking them to an additional, more concrete consequence. customers of a pasta restaurant were informed that we would make a small donation to an environmental organization for every purchase of a vegetarian pasta dish. the implementation of this prosocial incentive increased the odds of choosing vegetarian dish options by a significant 50 \% in comparison to a control condition and 75 \% in comparison to baseline. no significant dif-ferences were observed between a prosocial incentive that was framed in monetary terms and an even more tangible variant that linked vegetarian dish choices to the planting of trees. these results illustrate the effec-tiveness of prosocial incentives as a behavior change technique for reducing meat consumption and promoting vegetarian alternatives.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.futures.2024.103375},
  abstract = {Unconditional basic income (UBI) is one of the most discussed policy options for a degrowth transition. Advocates highlight UBI's theoretical potential to reduce unnecessary material consumption, alleviate poverty and redistribute social wealth, achieve wellbeing within ecological limits, shift activity from wage-labour to meaningful work, and facilitate increased social participation. However, UBI's radical potential remains under-examined within the empirical research, which focuses more on the policy's potential to increase the supply of wage-labour and stimulate economic growth. This paper aims to push back against this limiting trend. It begins by outlining some of the characteristics of more sustainable and just societies, based on post-growth perspectives, and outlines the arguments put forward to support UBI's compatibility with a degrowth transition. It then demonstrates that, despite support from UBI and many post-growth scholars, such arguments are not mainstreamed in the contemporary empirical UBI research. The paper argues that this increases the risk of UBI being captured by capitalist interests. To avoid this outcome, the paper proposes an alternative research agenda to help assess and advance UBI's radical potential in line with post-growth visions. © 2024 The Authors},

We compare selected model characteristics of 75 DG and PG related modeling studies, compiled through a systematic literature review (2000−2023), and link model structures and results to different theoretically contested debates surrounding DG/PG. The reviewed studies cover different geographical and temporal scopes, economic theories, modeling techniques and operationalizations of DG/PG. The majority of studies models DG/PG as intentional transition and does not question its compatibility with a capitalist system, while more radical strands of the DG/PG discourse are excluded. Although DG/PG modeling exercises frequently explore the effects of sustainability policies, they represent only a fraction of theoretical DG policy proposals, with the most frequent being: working time reduction, maximum income caps, carbon taxes and a universal basic income. DG/PG modeling studies have demonstrated the importance of integrating biophysical constraints in economic modeling but also have quantitatively assessed the feasibility of environmental integrity and social well-being without growth. Nonetheless, future modeling could be rendered more realistic by paying more attention to the Global South, introducing heterogeneous agents driving sustainability transitions and including multiple planetary boundaries. © 2024 The Authors},

These scenarios depict different pathways through which states approach ‘sustainability’, emphasizing reductions in the world economy's scale and shifts toward post-growth and/or ecocentric societies. The scenarios underscore the necessity of structural changes in the global politico-economic system alongside technological advancements. While FST1-6 outline opportunities for fast societal transformation catalyzed through ‘Black Swans’, they also point to significant obstacles to timely transitions.

It is interesting to note that demarketing is as old as marketing itself, yet its application and scope have grown from the past two decades only. Kotler and Levy, (1971) has defined demarketing as “that aspect of marketing which deals with discouraging customers in general or a certain class of customers in particular on a temporary or permanent basis”. This systematic literature review attempts to enrich the discussion on demarketing research through a systematic and comprehensive review of 64 articles published between 2000 and 2022. Using TCCM framework, we present relevant theories, research contexts, study characteristics, and methodologies used in demarketing research. Our review (1) Presents a systematic and comprehensive overview of the research in demarketing over the last two decades (2) Examines studies in demarketing within the framework of ‘triple bottom line’ approach for sustainability (3) Suggests a suitable definition of demarketing considering its exorbitant application within the sustainability context (4) Identify gaps and sets agenda for future research. Our systematic literature review found that research in demarketing has been growing considerably over the past two decades, twice as much in the last decade compared to the previous decade with spill-over to new sectors. The literature review, through the lens of ‘triple bottom line’ approach, is able to establish that demarketing can be employed to effectively address the sustainability challenges encountered by policymakers and practitioners. © 2023 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

The implications of these technologies and models, however, remain largely unclear. In many CE strategies, there is a high risk of rebound, meaning a situation in which activities aimed at environmental benefits are not realized because of external reasons. A similar risk relates to limited understanding about the behavioral changes required by extensive implementation of circular practices. Using life cycle assessment, we compare the global warming potential (GWP) of five ownership and end-of-life scenarios for creating and using a pair of jeans. The scenarios are as follows: (a) BASE, i.e. basic use with waste disposal, (b) REDUCE, i.e. extended use, (c) REUSE, i.e. re-selling, (d) RECYCLE, i.e. industrial processing into new raw materials, and (e) SHARE, i.e. a rental service. Our results show that the lowest global warming impacts are achieved in the REDUCE scenario, and the second lowest are achieved in the REUSE scenario. The RECYCLE scenario leads to relatively high overall emissions because the replaced emissions from cotton production are relatively low. The use of rental services is likely to increase customers' mobility, and if that happens in a large scale, then the SHARE scenario has the highest GWP. It was found that many new CE innovations come with a high rebound risk, and existing practices carry similar, yet smaller risks. © 2021 The Author(s).},

  abstract = {Novel alternative proteins have been in the spotlight due to increased awareness and desire to improve the sustainability of global food consumption. however, consumers still do not widely accept alternative proteins due to their inferior product quality compared to animal meat, and novelty. the adoption of these alternative proteins by consumers largely depends on its sensory appeal. sensory attributes like appearance, odour, taste, and texture shape consumer perception and purchasing decision of meat substitutes. likewise, non-product barriers such as familiarity, neophobia, cultural context, and government regulations influence consumer acceptance. this review will provide a consolidated update on the current challenges faced by cultured meats and insects, two upcoming and trending alternative proteins, and give a holistic view of consumer acceptance in terms of product quality as well as external non-product barriers. the first part of the review will provide an overview of each protein type, followed by discussion on their product- and non-product barriers to consumer acceptance. lastly, recently proposed solutions to overcome the barriers will be consolidated and evaluated. to overcome product-related barriers, various solutions have been proposed, including 3d-printing technology and fermentation. similarly, non-product barriers can be mitigated through policies, education, and framing theory. despite notable developments, achieving parity with animal meat is still a work in progress. suggestions on future research directions to bridge the gap in quality of cultured meat and edible insects, as well as understanding consumer perceptions and motivations behind adopting these novel proteins into habitual diet were provided.},

By integrating these perspectives, the review provides a holistic view, setting a foundation for targeted strategies in promoting PBMA adoption. This review identifies 26 antecedents from 53 articles, organized into four main categories: individual-related antecedents, socio-demographic factors, sociocultural factors, and product-related antecedents. Understanding consumers' perspectives on PBMA is crucial to developing strategies that encourage sustainable dietary changes. This review highlights the complexity of consumer decision-making regarding PBMA and underscores the need for multi-pronged strategies to enhance their acceptance and purchase intention. Furthermore, the TCM and ADO frameworks are used to identify literature gaps and suggest future research directions.

  abstract = {Effective decarbonization strategies employ both hard and soft measures to address climate change. soft approaches can deliver carbon savings comparable to hard approaches, which are typically both infrastructure - and investment-intensive and are often postponed due to financial risks. as demonstrated in this study, the time variable can be used as a lever to reduce energy demand through an academic calendar shift that aligns the end of fall term with thanksgiving break, thus reducing the need for redundant holiday travel among a significant population. if implemented at all undergraduate campuses of the university of california (uc) system, this strategy would produce a significant reduction (nearly 50,000 tco2e) in the annual carbon footprint of the uc, an impact approximately equal to decarbonizing all uc-owned vehicles. this outcome is robust to many of its key assumptions and can be realized at any higher education institution that sees a significant portion of its population travel for thanksgiving. the proposed academic calendar shift is a prime example of a soft decarbonization measure, it can be implemented within existing systems, provides numerous co-benefits, does not require new technologies, and augments ongoing hard decarbonization efforts that will lead to compounding benefits into the future.},

  abstract = {The rise of online flea markets in japan has expanded access to secondhand products. despite this expansion and the increasing recognition of the need for sustainable consumption, there remains a notable constraint on consumer acceptance of pre-owned items. thus, this study emphasizes the utility of secondhand product usage in a context where consumer acceptance of pre-owned items is limited despite the recognized sustainability necessity. additionally, it aims to investigate secondhand clothing-utilization patterns among users, estimate the environmental potential reduction, and assess their contribution to sustainable consumption. conducted on users of the japanese online flea market platform, mercari (sellers: n = 13,325, buyers: n = 9985), the study quantified the potential reduction in greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions by reusing secondhand clothing. utilizing a survey, the key findings revealed distinct reuse characteristics for different items, confirming extended product lifespan even for those in poor condition. moreover, secondhand products were used more frequently than new ones, and buyers exhibited less concern about potential damage. the displacement rate of secondhand for new clothing did not significantly decrease with worsening product condition. the study estimated a potential 9.6 thousand tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (ton-co2eq) reduction under the assumption of 10 million secondhand clothing items replacing new ones. this study proposes the feasibility of utilizing secondhand items and their potential contribution to environmental conservation in consumption. further, it establishes the theoretical foundation necessary to articulate the environmental significance of secondhand products. simultaneously, it provides valuable insights into the broader implications of sustainable consumption practices.},

Drawing on individual interviews with people who declare themselves as ‘living degrowth’ in French-speaking Switzerland, the article discusses everyday practices of consumption reduction that inform the actualisation of fundamental needs. The article proposes an operationalisation of Max-Neef’s approach of needs satisfaction, showing that an emphasis can be placed on sustainable practices representing synergic satisfiers. To support social change towards sufficiency, the article discusses that synergic satisfiers must be planned for collectively. Synergic collective changes are discussed in relation to synergic configurations of practices towards consumption reduction and needs satisfaction – or sufficiency. © 2024, Bristol University Press.

This paper assesses the mitigation potential of a comprehensive set of transport transformation strategies from an integrated modeling perspective. In doing so, it goes beyond the assessment of climate change by including health-related externalities. We analyze transformation scenarios clustered along three interventions: lifestyle changes (LSCs), electrification, and efficiency improvements. All clusters yield significant climate mitigation potential, with electrification most effectively reducing CO2 emissions. LSCs allow for immediate emission reductions, are effective in hard-to-electrify transport modes, and facilitate the overall energy system transformation. They also have the strongest impact on overall transport externalities, especially due to activity-related health benefits. When compared on a monetarized basis to the REF in 2050, for the EU, LSCs lead to a total benefit of 70 bn EUR/yr by reducing adverse externalities of motorized transport by 30},

  abstract = {A circular economy in which material flows are restored through closed-loop processes can diminish the negative effect of consuming durables on the environment. although recycling has received a lot of attention over the past few decades, this is actually not the preferred loop in a circular economy because it implies that much value is lost. this chapter takes a consumer's perspective on two of the more inner circles of the circular economy: prolonging the product's first life, and giving the product a second life through refurbishment. to prolong the first life, it is necessary that consumers can maintain and repair a product without much cost and effort. however, merely considering such technical durability is insufficient because many products are replaced while still functioning properly. designers should strive to design products that are also emotionally durable by stimulating the attachment the owner experiences with his/her product. product personalization, gracefully aging materials and storytelling are presented as effective design strategies to stimulate product attachment. nevertheless, it seems impossible to stimulate product attachment for all types of products. accordingly, designers need to consider the other inner circles of the circular economy as well. a promising strategy is to give products an effective second life via refurbishment. at present, consumers perceive refurbished products as having lower quality. for refurbishment to work, consumers need to accept refurbished products as substitutes for new products. several opportunities are discussed to enhance the perceived benefits of refurbished products and reduce the perceived risks through product design.},

  doi = {10.17226/21875},
  abstract = {Information and communication technologies, combined with smartphone applications and location data from global positioning systems, are making feasible transportation services that have long been imagined but never realized on a large scale. these innovations include carsharing, bikesharing, microtransit services, and, most notably, transportation network companies (tncs) such as uber and lyft. these services are being embraced by millions of travelers who are using their smartphones to arrange for trips by car, shuttle, and public transit, as well as for short-term rental of cars and bicycles. the rapid growth in these services follows and amplifies a rebound in travel by taxis and public transit that began more than a decade ago. the new services epitomize today's sharing economy and allow an increasing number of people to enjoy the mobility benefits of an automobile without owning one, and may encourage others to leave their personal vehicle at home for the day, reduce the number of vehicles in their household, or even forgo having one at all. notably, most of these innovations are occurring and being deployed in the private sector without public financial support, with the exception of bikesharing, which is typically publicly subsidized. whereas tncs have received the lion's share of media attention to date, the other innovative mobility services are growing, evolving, and expanding mobility while also reducing personal vehicle travel, greenhouse gas emissions, and possibly automobile ownership. although travel using innovative mobility services still represents a small share of total trips, a continued increase in customers and trips has substantial implications for the future. to date, the most rapidly growing forms of shared mobility entail sequential sharing of vehicles, with each user in turn having exclusive use of a motor vehicle or bicycle. potentially more consequential, but still in its infancy, is concurrent sharing of vehicles among strangers. by increasing vehicle occupancy, this form of shared services may collectively have greater effects - in terms of affordable personal mobility, vehicle use, energy consumption, traffic congestion, and environmental benefits - relative to today's most popular new sequential mobility options. at the same time that innovative mobility services are being enthusiastically embraced by tech-sawy travelers, they do raise public policy issues. for example, those without credit accounts and smartphones cannot access many of these new services, and helmet requirements may increase safety but can discourage bikesharing. the most controversial new services to date are clearly tncs, which are growing rapidly in popularity, spreading to cities around the globe, disrupting the regulated for-hire taxi industry, and posing a series of challenges to transportation and regulatory policy makers. these challenges include • an uneven regulatory playing field affecting competition in jurisdictions that impose substantial regulations on taxis and lesser requirements on tncs, an issue magnified by the national scale andinfluence oftncs compared withmostly local taxi companies, • inconsistent requirements for drivers and for vehicle safety and insurance for taxis and tncs, requirements whose efficacy, in any case, lacks systematic assessment, and • the implications of a decline in or even the demise of taxi companies in places where low-income, disabled, and older persons rely on taxis, including wheelchair-accessible taxis, for lifeline services. coupled with these issues are the varying requirements for tncs, taxis, and limousines imposed by different regulatory bodies within the same geographic area. a key challenge for policy makers at all levels of government, then, is to both encourage and facilitate innovations that meet the public's mobility needs while achieving greater public policy consistency among these new services and between them and traditional taxi and livery services. addressing the above challenges in such rapidly growing and evolving industries is itself challenging. doing so will require political will, more information about the scale and nature of the services being provided, and insightful, effective public policies to guide the evolution of these innovative services so as to enhance mobility, sus-tainability, and public safety. although it is too early to draw definitive conclusions, the development of such public policies will require careful analysis of both the potential benefits and risks of evolving and expanding shared mobility services. in particular, the continued expansion of these services has potentially important implications for the location preferences of households and firms, and for their travel patterns generally and their use of public transit specifically in the years ahead. in addition, substantial growth in the concurrent sharing of vehicles could meaningfully contribute to the attainment of resource-efficient and environmentally sustainable lifestyles. the committee that conducted this study concludes that innovative mobility services can provide broad mobility benefits while serving other societal goals, but that reaping these benefits will require informed policy making. the committee favors a carefully calibrated regulatory approach for both innovative mobility services and the traditional services with which they frequently compete - an approach that accomplishes public policy goals and creates a level playing field while still allowing the full spectrum of mobility services ample opportunity to innovate and compete. the committee's recommendations, elaborated in chapter 9 of this report, are intended to provide guidance to policy makers and regulators in addressing the issues associated with the new mobility services.and taxi drivers. recommendation 4. policy makers and regulators should seek to integrate the features oftncs and other innovative shared mobility services into existing transportation systems and services in ways that leverage the new services' strengths and features. also identified in chapter 9 are needs for research to inform policy making and regulation, along with a clearinghouse for sharing information, methodologies for integrating shared mobility services into planning initiatives, and the development of consistent definitions and information-sharing requirements for service providers. copyright 2016, national academies of science. all rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The substitution of meat products with plant-based meat (PBM) alternatives is seen to foster sustainable consumption. It can play an important role in helping reach greenhouse gas emission targets. While consumers generally perceive PBM alternatives as more environmentally friendly and healthier than meat, they often find them less hedonically appealing and too expensive, which hinders their widespread adoption. One effective strategy to encourage consumers toward more sustainable choices is the use of front-of-pack information, such as claims and labels. This study identifies the most effective labeling strategy to increase consumers' preference for PBM burger patties through a three-fold research approach, namely, a supermarket audit in the UK, a best-worst scaling study (i.e., Maximum Difference Scaling), and a discrete choice experiment (i.e., choice-based conjoint analysis). In the UK market, front-of-pack labels and claims presented on PBM products can be categorized into those primarily related to nutrition, ecological welfare, and taste. These categories correspond to three distinct consumer segments extracted from a best-worst scaling study. A subsequent discrete choice experiment, which compared labeled PBM patties vis-à-vis meat patties, revealed that a third-party accredited taste label has the potential to gain the highest market share and willingness-to-pay among all types of labels/claims. Our findings underscore the importance of adopting an appropriate labeling strategy to foster sustainable food consumption. © 2024},

The present paper brings into dialogue the two fields by contemplating what circularity in business could entail in the context of transformations towards degrowth societies. To this end, the paper relates to a recent, holistic reconceptualisation which views degrowth transformations in terms of both less and more on four planes of social being: material transactions with nature, social interactions between people, social structures and people's inner being. These planes signify depth of social being. The paper looks at business through the lens of this reconceptualisation before zooming in on circularity as an important manifestation of a sustainability practice in business. We argue that, in the context of degrowth, implementation of circularity as a principle and a practice should be deep. Relating circularity to each plane of social being, we focus particularly on the plane of people's inner being, the reason being that our mode of relating with the world would need to be significantly different to what it currently is, if deep circularity practices are to become more widespread. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

A significant portion of this waste consists of edible leftovers that could be repurposed instead of discarded. However, leftover reuse remains an underexplored strategy for reducing food waste, despite its potential to contribute to more sustainable food consumption. By framing leftover reuse as a sufficiency-driven behavior, this study positions it as a key strategy for reducing food waste and fostering responsible consumption. Following a mixed method approach consisting of qualitative interviews, a survey and creative sessions with designers, this research explores the psychological factors that influence individuals' intentions to reuse food leftovers and provides practical design strategies to encourage leftover reuse. Based on a dataset of 244 households in the Netherlands, we use Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to test a conceptual model grounded in psychological constructs, assessing factors influencing intention to reuse leftover food. The findings reveal that attitudes, and personal norms are significant factors in encouraging reuse of leftover food, while perceived health risks negatively affect attitudes towards reuse. Based on qualitative and quantitative insights, six evidence-based design strategies were developed to address both psychological motivators and practical challenges. The results contribute to the literature and practice by highlighting the psychological determinants of food leftover reuse and proposing interventions to foster sustainable food consumption practices. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd},

Working time reduction plays a pivotal role in those transitional strategies to relax the trade-off between economic growth and unemployment. This analysis contributes to the research by developing a macroeconomic model where, in contrast to the existing models, a sufficient profit rate is the precondition of any private-sector economic activity. It is shown that under such assumptions working time reduction is not enough to stabilize output but is a threat to macroeconomic stability. To make the post-growth transition successful, working time reduction must go along with supporting economic policies and macroeconomic governance including public investment, which controls the private-sector profit rate to avoid instability and unemployment. © 2023 The Author},

The period of so-called 'secular stagnation' intensifies the threats of unemployment, wage pressure, and deteriorating living conditions. Policy strategies that make the economy independent of the growth imperative to reduce resource consumption while maintaining a high quality of life require macroeconomic governance. This article provides an overview of the main policy proposals to avoid secular stagnation to argue that tackling the growth dilemma requires the macroeconomic management of the drivers of growth, that is, effective demand and profitability. The contradiction between these two growth drivers becomes ever more prevalent in the age of secular stagnation and reveals the analytical gaps ecological economics research should focus on. © 2023 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

Rather than advancing an alternative to GDP growth, it highlights how tensions between the pursuit of growth and the pursuit of sustainability might be reduced using conceptual resources drawn from within established approaches to national accounting and GDP measurement. Although far from a panacea, changes in technocratic practices of national accounting could reduce economic and political barriers to green transition policies. © 2023},

The question is how exactly basic needs satisfaction, flourishing societies, and limited throughput can come together. Based on the insight that decent living standards constrain the slope of the Lorenz curve for the lowest decile, a simple model can be derived that determines total consumption from only three factors: per capita decent living standards, the Gini coefficient of inequality, and population. With a constraint on maximum living standards, overall consumption splits into three components: basic needs satisfaction, prosperous consumption, and excessive consumption. The model calculates sustainable consumption corridors based on decent living standards and the acceptable maximum under ecological ceilings, while still allowing for reasonable levels of inequality and ample prosperous consumption. The model can be applied to economic and physical stock and flow indicators, and examples for all four combinations are provided. The work concludes with calling upon the research community to assess the inequality of physical stock and flow indicators related to human wellbeing, identify suitable physical wellbeing measures, and extend the debate on desirable levels of inequality to physical socio-metabolic indicators. © 2024 The Author},

It provides substance to degrowth-compatible understandings of frugality and of abundance based on frugality, stressing the importance of the autonomous and pluriversal design of ‘enough’. It highlights that human material desires can be finite and satiated under some societal organisations and cultures. It also proposes a definition of a society of frugal abundance: it is a society in which everyone has a good life, consumption is low enough to achieve global ecological and social justice, and the material wants of everyone are satisfied.

Using a comparative analysis of the two research fields, we confirm several findings from previous reviews, including that Green Growth research is highly policy oriented, focuses on practical implementation and builds on empirical research methods, while Degrowth research is highly theory-driven, focuses on the analysis of complex human-nature interrelationships and builds on a sound theoretical and conceptual foundation. Our analysis further reveals that Green Growth and Degrowth are two rather isolated fields of research with little exchange and mutual reference on related topics. However, the topic of social change and transition represents an intersecting and promising future research area. We derive four generalizable recommendations that address current shortcomings and interdisciplinary potentials of Degrowth and Green Growth research and contribute to shaping the future of social-ecological transformation research. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

Design/methodology/approach: This research employed a descriptive, quantitative and cross-sectional design, examining data from 530 Indian tourists who used sharing economy-based services. The proposed conceptual model was evaluated through partial least squares-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM), and the impact of control variables was examined via PLS-multi-group analysis (PLS-MGA). Findings: The study findings validated that religiosity, resource sharing and environmental attitudes significantly foster minimalist behaviour in sharing economy-based services. This minimalist behaviour, in turn, positively impacts customer citizenship behaviour, affecting aspects such as tolerance, feedback, advocacy and assistance to others. The model's outcomes also indicated the substantial moderating roles of age and gender. Originality/value: This study is novel in its exploration of how religiosity, resource sharing and environmental attitudes as stimuli can shape minimalist behaviour within sharing economy-based services and further influence customer citizenship behaviour. By uncovering the significant roles of age and gender in this context, the research offers unique insights into understanding the dynamics of consumer behaviour within the burgeoning sharing economy.

It builds on degrowth scholarship that considers cultural change an integral part of sustainability transformations. The article envisions what that change could look like by developing non-anthropocentric and de-individualised visions of sustainability transformations. It thereby advances recently reignited debates around limits to growth and artificial scarcity. Buen Vivir/sumak kawsay is an Andean-Amazonian indigenous conceptualisation of Good Living. An engagement with the reciprocal practices, behaviours and rituals of its protagonists yields three insights for the cultural politics of degrowth. First, cosmological limits to growth are normative constraints to harming the Living World and arise from relational ontologies that embed the human into the natural world. Second, the political economy of Buen Vivir/sumak kawsay produces affective abundance via reciprocity with the non-human world. This offers a de-individualised understanding of abundance for degrowth, beyond enjoyment and provision of universal basic services. Third, these ideas can be implemented in practice through Rights of Nature, put forward here as a viable policy option because of its potential to impute relational worldviews into materialist understandings of nature. These pluriverse avenues can enact cultural change towards sustainability transformations. © 2024 The Author},

  abstract = {To strengthen current discourse on acceleration and scale up of the emissions mitigation actions by sector-specific demand side actions, information on the intersection of three dimensions becomes useful. First, what kind of actions help in avoiding, shifting and improving demand for activities/services and resultant emissions to help in deciding choices for actions, second, how these three categories of actions are linked to the wider impact on human wellbeing represented by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) framework, and third, who are the actors associated with these mitigation actions. These three steps become important in the targeted scaling up of actions through policy interventions. This study undertakes a review of the literature between 2015 and 2020 with systematic evidence searching and screening. The literature search has been conducted in Scopus Database. From over 6887 literature in the initial search, 294 relevant literature were finally reviewed to link demand side interventions of avoid-shift-improve (ASI) categories to SDGs. It also maps these actions to actors who can lead the changes. Results show that a wide range of improvement actions are already helping in incremental steps to reduce demand and emissions in various services like mobility, shelter and industrial products. However, ASI categories provide more distinct mitigation actions. All actions need support of innovation, infrastructure development and industrialization. Actions that interact with several SDGs include active mode of transport, passive building design, cleaner cooking, and circular economy. Positive links of these actions to multiple SDGs are overall very strong, however, few trade-offs have been observed. These are mostly related to distributional impact across social groups which highlight the need for policy attention and hard infrastructure design changes. Mitigation and wider benefit outcomes cannot be achieved by individual or household level actions alone. They require the involvement of multiple actors, interconnected actions in sequence as well as in parallel, and support of hard infrastructure. Our results show that in mobility services, policy makers supported by spatial planners and service delivery providers are the major actors. In industry, major actors are policy makers followed by spatial planners and innovators. For buildings, key actors include spatial planners followed by policy makers. Besides these, strategic information sharing to enhance user awareness and education plays an important role in shaping behaviour. Digitalization, information and communication, and interactive technologies will play a significant role in understanding and modifying people's choices, however, these would also require regulatory attention. © 2021 The Author(s).

As demand for fresh water rises and supply declines, a growing number of towns will be compelled to respond to water shortages. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to determine the effect of demarketing strategies on consumer attitudes toward household water consumption. An empirical research was conducted to test the hypotheses, using primary data collected via a survey questionnaire. A structural equation model (SEM) is used to examine the data collected from 356 users. The findings reveal that there is a relationship between independent variables (i.e. product, price, place, and promotion), and consumer attitudes toward household water consumption. Furthermore, the moderator “regulation beliefs” reinforced these relationships. © NSP 2023 Natural Sciences Publishing Cor.},

  abstract = {Lifestyle changes are key factors of the climate mitigation challenge because they drive the demand for energy, goods and food. They have received growing attention in the development and assessment of mitigation pathways, one of the key approaches used to inform mitigation policies. This paper contributes to this emerging literature by examining the political and scientific implications of integrating lifestyle changes into mitigation pathways. We analyse a large sample of pathways, supplemented by interviews with practitioners, to provide a perspective relevant to both scenario production practices themselves and the science-policy process in which they are included. We use three illustrative pathways to describe what it means to explore lifestyle changes and how this exploration can be conducted (indicators, dimensions, precision). We summarize the observed benefits of the explorations of lifestyle changes in scenario production by considering three main contributions of scenarios to policy decision-making: explicit knowledge, mediation tools and framing power. We also discuss why the integration of lifestyle changes poses a potential challenge to the robustness and reliability of pathway production methodologies, which is a condition for their policy-relevance. We therefore argue that the implications of this integration need to be carefully characterized in order to maximize the policy relevance of the analysis without compromising the robustness of the scenario development and assessment process. The nature of lifestyles, which reflect values and preferences and require a multidisciplinary approach, raises significant policy neutrality challenges and scientific challenges. Overcoming these challenges can lead to more policy-relevant pathways: we describe existing approaches in the literature and analyse their contributions and limitations. © 2020 The Author(s).

This article makes a twofold argument about the need to closely interlink these. Degrowth and ecological reparations discourses, policies and related movements could gain from strengthening their connections and a mutual integration of core perspectives and demands. On the one hand, we argue that degrowth needs to develop into a global justice perspective by integrating demands for (ecological) reparations, freedom of movement, and a global-justice oriented reshaping of the international economic system—demands most prominently articulated from Global South movements. Without this global justice outlook, degrowth risks becoming an inward-looking, provincial, localized, and eventually exclusive project within Europe and the Global North. On the other hand, demands for reparations—strongly articulated from the Global South—could benefit from incorporating the call for degrowth in the Global North. Without this call—which can, of course, be articulated by using different terms—the reparations agenda risks a key opportunity to address core structural and systemic drivers of extractive processes. © 2023, Society for International Development.},

  abstract = {There is an urgent need to mitigate carbon emissions in the building sector, particularly from existing buildings. the existing literature focuses predominantly on technological strategies such as low-carbon materials. this prompts the question: can technological strategies alone drive the decarbonization of buildings, or are non- technological strategies also essential? although recent research considers the benefits of the latter, studies assessing the potential of non-technological strategies for decarbonization of buildings are lacking because of the challenges involved in evaluating the indirect impacts and potential trade-offs associated with these strategies such as their ripple effects on mobility. this study pioneers a comparative assessment to evaluate the environmental mitigation potential of non-technological strategies (adaptation, a subset of the sharing economy, and behavioral changes) against technological strategies (low-carbon materials, retrofitting, and recycled materials) to ascertain the effectiveness of non-technological approaches. through life cycle assessment, this study extends beyond solely evaluating the ghg reduction potential to assess the overall environmental mitigation capacity. a single-family house in montreal was used as a reference scenario. with significant mitigation potential observed from a non-technological perspective, the results robustly reveal that the adaptation scenario surpasses all scenarios, including retrofitting, which is the primary mitigation strategy for existing buildings, by up to 50 \% and 41 \% at the midpoint and damage levels, respectively. furthermore, the adaptation scenario potentially provides sufficiency by saving considerable amounts of material and energy, thereby alleviating the environmental impact of the production and use stages by up to 27 \% and 15 \%, respectively. this study also evaluates the combined effects of adaptation and retrofitting for existing buildings, revealing by up to 8 \% greater environmental benefits at the midpoint and damage levels than in the adaptation scenario individually. these results highlight the potential of non-technological strategies that are currently overlooked in the building sector. however, their implementation requires fewer resources and less energy than technological changes. therefore, further investigation is warranted to explore how adopting these strategies, along with technological ones, is advantageous.},

The mandates of the United Nations (UN) peacekeeping operations often contain the promotion of economic growth as a prerequisite for post-conflict recovery and sustainable peace. However, the relationship between peace and economic growth needs re-examination in light of urgent calls for global sustainability and climate action. To do this, I first review the claims and critiques that economic growth is a precondition for peace. I then revisit past peacebuilding cases where the promotion of economic growth has either corresponded with or led to environmental degradation and unequal distribution of resources, contributing to new or renewed forms of violence. Finally, I explore the prospects of post-growth peacebuilding based on recent efforts to make UN peacekeeping operations more attuned to environmental considerations and the changing climate. Post-growth peacebuilding is not just about reducing the environmental footprint of peacekeeping, it is, more importantly, about breaking away from the linear and growth-driven path of peace and development towards intergenerational and ecological justice. © The Author(s), 2024.},

While Keynes favoured growing the economy in the short-run, he also saw the potential for a post-growth economy in the long-run. He implied that the realisation of this economy would be consistent with the ending of capitalism itself. There are different versions of Keynes (this partly reflects the volume and range of his published work as well as the tendency for his own thought to evolve over time in response to particular events) and the interpretation given of his economics is inevitably partial and potentially contentious. However, the ideas presented provide an indication of the relevance and importance of Keynes's writings for post-growth economics debates. Keynes's vision of long-run economic transition contains some weaknesses and there remain issues in applying his ideas to problems in the present – this includes the notion of ‘Green Keynesianism’ as a response to the challenge of climate change – but there are still valuable lessons to take from Keynes. Modern post-growth economists are therefore encouraged to engage with his ideas. © 2025 The Author},

We build on recent research highlighting that group boundaries may impede dietary change by (a) promoting pro-meat norms and (b) prohibiting critical calls for a veg* diet (vegetarian and vegan, i.e., meat-free). Past research relied on self-reports and behavioural measures of engagement, leaving open whether these effects extend to food consumption settings and ad-hoc meal choice. We conducted two pre-registered experiments in which meat-eaters read critical calls to adopt a veg* diet, either by a vegan (outgroup) or a meat-eater (ingroup). In Experiment 2, participants moreover read an article either highlighting a veg* or a meat-eating norm. We then assessed actual (Experiment 1) or hypothetical (Experiment 2) meal choice as dependent variables. As predicted, intergroup criticism (i.e., voiced by veg*s) consistently led to message rejection in comparison to the same criticism voiced by meat eaters, but we did not observe effects on meal choice. Norms neither had a main nor interaction effect on self-reports and behaviour. We discuss potential intermediary processes between engagement with and adoption of a vegan diet and derive evidence-based recommendations for constructive communication across group boundaries. © 2024},

  abstract = {Sustainable production and consumption are categorized as target 12 in the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. The “sharing economy” has been developing globally as a new consumption style, and it is often recognized as being environmentally friendly by both consumers and service providers. Several aspects of the practice, such as the avoidance of new production, can reduce the impact to the environment. However, additional factors, such as the expansion of consumption, namely rebound effects, can increase the impact to the environment. Although many variables exist to determine the total impact of sharing services on the environment, additional and rebound effects and the uncertainty of influential variables have not been well considered. In this study, we aim to reveal the conditions that car-sharing practices place in increasing or decreasing environmental loads, and to identify the significant influential factors on the environment imposed by car-sharing services. We analyze the CO2 emission of car sharing by considering various influential factors and their distributions. Furthermore, we consider differences in car size, fuel type, ownership condition, and several other factors in the simulation. The distribution of each variable is determined, and a Monte Carlo simulation is conducted. The CO2 emissions from the production and operational stages over a 10-y period are estimated. The simulation is conducted with sensitivity analysis to identify the variables that contribute significantly to the total CO2 emission. In some cases, the CO2 emission involved in car sharing exceeded cases in which car sharing is not practiced. Among those cases, although the main contributor to the total CO2 emission is in the operational stage, CO2 emission from the production stage increased the amount of emission. It is discovered that the number of cars increased significantly during the target 10 y after sharing is introduced in some cases. These results indicate a high probability that car sharing can achieve CO2 reduction, but the increase in CO2 emission can occur under certain conditions. Additionally, the sensitivity analysis shows that the main determinants of CO2 emission are the ratio of people who eliminated their private cars, degree of rebound effect, and increasing ratio of number of cars introduced to car-sharing practices. This suggests that whether car sharing becomes environmentally friendly depends substantially on consumer behavior and the manner in which sharing services are operated.},

In this context, the prevailing vulnerability of livelihoods to a reduction in output poses a fundamental threat, and obstructs stringent environmental policies that reduce production or consumption. This study explores what creates this vulnerability, and how it might be overcome. We introduce a novel analytic framework that describes the relationship between economic output and the adequacy of livelihoods. Using empirical data for the years around the Global Financial Crisis, we illustrate the vulnerability of livelihoods in the UK. Based on our framework, we show that the vulnerability is not inevitable but arises when livelihoods are dependent on wage labour whilst employment and adequate incomes for workers are insecure, or when adequate pensions are insecure. These conditions are pervasive in contemporary capitalist economies, primarily due to profit maximisation and neoliberal welfare and labour policy. Profit maximisation may in fact actively foster the vulnerability of livelihoods, as the vulnerability can be used as a lever for squeezing wages, and as a pretext for pursuing economic growth and blocking environmental policies. Finally, we identify a range of interventions that could overcome the vulnerability, including specific versions of universal basic services, a universal basic income, a minimum income guarantee, a job guarantee, living wages, worktime reduction, and a pension guarantee, alongside changes in capital-labour relations and a shift to not-for-profit provisioning. Such interventions could secure livelihoods in volatile or contracting economies, and make stringent environmental policies socially sustainable and more politically palatable. © 2023},

  abstract = {In the absence of a deliberate focus on gender, efforts towards sustainable transitions run the risk of perpetuating the inequalities present in the fossil fuel-dependent economic system. demands for a gender-just transition have gained increasing prominence within the political landscape in recent times. however, they are hardly reflected in the scientific debate on a just transition, which is why the paper explores and maps the political narratives around a gender-just transition. a search for grey literature in english on a global level without a country focus results in a collection of 65 political documents. these are analysed using the narrative policy framework. the following six narratives are worked out: (1) representation narrative, (2) policy design narrative, (3) fossil phaseout narrative, (4) opportunity narrative, (5) protection narrative, and (6) transformation narrative. with reference to feminist theories, it is examined which ideas of gender justice underlie the narratives. the narratives represent very different approaches to achieving greater gender equity in the sustainability transition. they range from increasing the proportion of women on the boards of green industries to a fundamental shift away from a growth-based economic system. the paper shows how the narratives could complement each other in a multi-layered vision for a gender-just transition facilitating alliance building.},

We conducted two experiments to examine how the context of commensal eating might influence people's food choices. In Experiment 1, we asked participants to imagine eating alone or with others, and then to choose three dishes from a choice set consisting of two meat and two vegetable dishes, so they had to choose between a meat-heavy meal and a vegetable-forward meal. Consequently, the participants showed a stronger choice preference for the meat-heavy meals in commensal eating compared to solitary eating, and the symbolic meaning of foods mediated this effect. In Experiment 2, participants were divided into different groups and primed with beliefs regarding the symbolic meanings of certain foods before making food choices. Consequently, the participants chose fewer meat-heavy meals in commensal eating after they were primed with the belief that vegetables could symbolize status and wealth, compared to those without such priming. Collectively, these findings reveal the mechanisms underlying the effect of commensality on the choices of meat-heavy meals, which has implications for nudging people toward making sustainable food choices in social settings. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd},

  doi = {10.13587/j.cnki.jieem.2023.06.005},
  abstract = {The outbreak of covid-19 in 2020 prevented consumers from spending freely during the epidemic stay-at-home period, bringing about many instances of retaliatory consumption. in the long run, people ‘ s endogenous view of living in the present is reinforced by the uncertainty of the external environment. in addition, as various marketing techniques continue to stimulate individual consumption patterns, individuals consume more than they really need. although there are many adverse effects of excessive consumption on consumers, companies and society, no clear conclusions have been drawn from existing research on the relationship between marketing orientation and excessive consumption behavior, the mechanisms and boundary conditions between marketing orientation and consumer regret. to address this issue, three pre-experiments, one quasi-experiment (study 1) and two laboratory experiments (study 2) were designed to investigate the above questions. the purpose of the three pre-experiments was to determine the experimental material needed for the subsequent study, and all three pretests used a one-way within-group experimental design. the results of pre-experiment 1, which aimed to determine the specific experimental scenario of this study, indicated that the hotpot, chinese food and fast food categories were the types of food in which consumers were always most likely to engage in excessive consumption behavior in their daily lives. pre-experiment 2, which aimed to test whether the advertising slogans of different marketing orientations were manipulated correctly, showed that most subjects could correctly judge the marketing orientations embodied in the advertising slogans. pre-experiment 3, which was designed to test the rationality of the experimental material, showed that the contents of the set meals were sufficiently reasonable in terms of portion size and price. given this, the experimental materials studied in the three pre-experiments were considered valid for the subsequent study. the first step is to prove that marketing orientation can indeed cause the occurrence of excessive consumption behavior. in study 1, a quasi-experimental research method was used to investigate the effect of marketing orientation on excessive consumption behavior by selecting a “pre-test and post-test with control group” experimental design. in study 1, 210 subjects were openly recruited, of which 196 were valid subjects. the results of the study showed that marketing has a facilitative effect on excessive consumption behavior, while de-marketing has an inhibitory effect. according to study 1, marketing orientation can indeed influence excessive consumption behavior, which provides a basis for study 2 to explore the relationship between marketing orientation and consumer regret based on different marketing orientations. study 2 used an experimental design approach to construct a moderated mediation model based on the attribution theory. study 2 was devoted to exploring the mechanisms and boundary conditions between marketing orientation and consumer regret. in study 2, a total of two formal experiments were designed, of which, formal experiment 1, which used a one-way between-groups experimental design, explored the mechanisms of the effects of marketing and de-marketing on consumer regret. in the formal experiment 1, 100 subjects were recruited, and 92 subjects were finally valid. based on the results, it can be concluded that responsibility attribution plays a mediating role between marketing orientation and regret. specifically, de-marketing makes consumers more inclined to internal attribution and regret is increased, while marketing makes consumers more inclined to external attribution and regret is decreased. in the formal experiment 2, the aim was to explore the moderating effect of self-control on the relationship between responsibility attribution and regret. a total of 220 subjects were recruited and 197 final valid subjects were recruited. based on the results, it can be concluded that self-control not only moderates the relationship between responsibility attribution and regret, but also moderates the strength of the mediating effect of responsibility attribution. the findings of the study have certain implications on marketing orientation in academia. on the one hand, from the research field, the research conducted in this paper extends de-marketing from the national macro-consumption level to the individual microconsumption level, and the discussion of de-marketing goes deeper into the consumer group, so the research findings are more universal to consumers. on the other hand, from the research content, existing scholars mainly use the explanatory level theory to discuss demarketing, but the single mechanism cannot completely explain the inner mechanisms of marketing orientation on marketing effects. this study introduces attribution theory to investigate the role of different dimensions of causes. in conclusion, this study focuses on the process of consumer psychological and emotional changes after the occurrence of excessive consumption behavior from an atonement perspective, which is an important research basis for subsequent excessive consumption behavior. therefore, for the society, de-marketing should be promoted as much as possible to warn excessive consumption behavior. on the other hand, consumers should improve their internal attribution tendency and self-control from the perspective of personal management in order to improve their regret and change their subsequent excessive consumption behavior. © (2023), (zhejiang university). all rights reserved.},

(2) how do psychosocial factors influence environmentally sustainable dietary choices? (3) what interventions are effective in changing consumers' dietary choices? the results showed that there is a gap between the actual and perceived environmental impacts of dietary choices, including organic food, local seasonal food and food packages. although transitioning from a meat-based diet to a plant-based one, reducing food waste, and adopting efficient cooking methods can bring considerable environmental benefits, barriers such as inconvenience, price, and neophobia significantly hinder behavior changes. besides, the influence of environmental concern on most environmentally sustainable diets is weak, whereas health concern plays a significant role. in practice, a long-term change in dietary structure could be achieved by addressing cultural barriers and social norms, through the cooperation of governments, retailers, food producers, and consumers.},

To develop effective public policies, it is crucial to understand the energy-saving behavior of households. This study delves into the determinants of energy-saving practices in a developing country. Design/methodology/approach: The authors chose a multivariate probit model, as it allowed to look after possible correlations among seven energy-saving practices within households. Findings: The findings underscore the significant influence of sociodemographic variables, such as gender, civil status, income and education, on energy-saving practices. Furthermore, the authors discovered that households where the head actively volunteers in social organizations are more likely to adopt energy-saving behaviors. Additionally, internet access positively contributes to pro-environmental behavior. This research reveals that certain energy-saving practices are interconnected, acting as complements or substitutes. Research limitations/implications: Recommendations for public policy include prioritizing education in rural areas to boost energy-saving practices, improving internet access in nonurban regions and promoting citizen involvement in social organizations to enhance environmental awareness and encourage energy-saving behavior. The authors contribute to literature evidencing that certain energy-saving practices are not independent of each other, they are rather complementary and, in some cases, substitutes. Practical implications: Recommendations for public policy include prioritizing education in rural areas to boost energy-saving practices, improving Internet access in nonurban regions and promoting citizen involvement in social organizations to enhance environmental awareness and encourage energy-saving behavior.

  abstract = {The circular economy (ce) aims to decouple the growth of the economy from the consumption of finite resources through strategies, such as eliminating waste, circulating materials in use, and regenerating natural systems. due to the rapid development of data science (ds), promising progress has been made in the transition toward ce in the past decade. ds offers various methods to achieve accurate predictions, accelerate product sustainable design, prolong asset life, optimize the infrastructure needed to circulate materials, and provide evidence-based insights. despite the exciting scientific advances in this field, there still lacks a comprehensive review on this topic to summarize past achievements, synthesize knowledge gained, and navigate future research directions. in this paper, we try to summarize how ds accelerated the transition to ce. we conducted a critical review of where and how ds has helped the ce transition with a focus on four areas including (1) characterizing socioeconomic metabolism, (2) reducing unnecessary waste generation by enhancing material efficiency and optimizing product design, (3) extending product lifetime through repair, and (4) facilitating waste reuse and recycling. we also introduced the limitations and challenges in the current applications and discussed opportunities to provide a clear roadmap for future research in this field.},

  abstract = {In light of current unsustainability trends, achieving major sustainability goals, such as the protection of life on land and below water (sdg 14 and 15), requires transformative change. this paper focuses on transformative change of values and, for this, on the idea of a nature-respecting sufficiency. sustainability discussions are motivated by two important sufficiency considerations: a focus on basic needs and on reaching and securing a social minimum for all, and a social maximum via a focus on limits to production and consumption. this intuitive appeal derives from the idea of minimum threshold as a central requirement of justice along with the idea of justice demanding respect for environmental limits. this paper proposes a nature-respecting, capabilitarian conception of sufficiency. its starting point is the dignity of all living beings and their central capabilities. rather than being indifferent about distribution in the space above a sufficiency threshold, this conception requires resource use above the threshold to be justified. for both the agency and patiency aspects of moral subjects, the positional and quasi-positional nature of central capabilities plays an important role, orienting intrinsic and instrumental reasons towards equal distribution. implications of nature-respecting sufficiency are discussed in relation to (sustainable) economy and the technological and social innovations highlighted by the 2019 global biodiversity assessment.},
